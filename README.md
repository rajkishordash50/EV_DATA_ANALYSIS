Electric Vehicle Registration Analysis

This project is an analysis of electric vehicle (EV) registration data in Washington State, USA. The goal of this project is to explore the trends and patterns in EV registration data and to build a linear regression model to predict the electric range of EVs.

Data

The data used in this project is a CSV file containing EV registration data in Washington State, USA. The data includes variables such as:

- Vehicle ID
- Make
- Model
- Electric Vehicle Type
- Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility
- Electric Range
- Base MSRP
- Vehicle Location (Latitude and Longitude)
- County
- City
- State
- Postal Code

Analysis

The analysis is divided into four parts:

1. *Data Cleaning*: Handling missing values, duplicate records, and anonymizing VINs.
2. *Data Exploration*: Exploring the trends and patterns in EV registration data.
3. *Data Visualization*: Visualizing the EV registration data using maps and plots.
4. *Linear Regression Model*: Building a linear regression model to predict the electric range of EVs.

Code

The code is written in Python and uses the following libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- folium
- scikit-learn

Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using pip.
